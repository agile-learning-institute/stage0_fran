# Design Thinking Workshop - What to Expect

Stage0 Design Thinking Workshops are a text-chat based online experience, facilitated by a chat-bot in a discord text channel. Fran, the workshop facilitator bot, will guide you through a series of design thinking exercises, each designed to capture our individual observations, reflect as a group to understand those observations, and make decisions about how we move forward. 

What to Expect:
Once the workshop begins, (when someone says @Fran_the_facilitator please start the workshop) Fran will introduce a series of Exercises. Each exercise follows the design thinking Observe/Reflect/Make loop one time.
	•	Observe: During this activity, participants will simply type their observations as messages. This is a time for individual contributions, so focus on sharing your thoughts without expecting immediate responses or engaging in discussions. Remember to keep your observations concise—just like writing on sticky notes with a Sharpie.
	•	Reflect: During this activity, Fran will prompt the team with questions to help deduplicate, group, and explore the observations that were made. This is a collaborative phase where we’ll dive deeper into the insights we’ve gathered.
	•	Make: In this activity, Fran will help us identify the observations that are the most important. We’ll focus on a single observation that will drive the scope for our next exercise, while also noting other observations that may require additional follow-up.

Additional Reminders:
	•	Practice innovative thinking and use “yes, and” approaches to build on ideas.
	•	Remember that “Why” questions focus on seeking understanding, not questioning the merit of ideas.
	•	Embrace absurd or magical thinking, as it can lead to practical and innovative ideas.
	•	Focus on quantity over quality; it’s better to have ten crazy ideas than one stupendous one.

Throughout the workshop, Fran will structure our sessions, ensuring we stay on course and make the most of our time together.
