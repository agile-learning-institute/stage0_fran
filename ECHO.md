# Echo - A Multi-Party Conversational AI Framework

Echo is a Python-based chatbot framework inspired by Flask. Echo enables **multi-party conversational AI** by acting as a bridge between **human group conversations (outer dialog)** and **structured agent interactions (inner dialog).**

## **How Echo Works**
- Echo operates in **two conversational layers:**
  - **Outer Dialog:** The LLM interacts naturally with users in a group chat.
  - **Inner Dialog:** The LLM privately communicates with structured agents to retrieve and execute information.
- The LLM follows a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** approach:
  - **Interprets human intent** from the group chat.
  - **Generates structured agent requests** to gather information or perform actions.
  - **Formats agent responses** into human-readable answers before sending them back to the group.

## **🚀 Features**
- **Agent-based command routing** using `/agent/action/arguments` syntax.
- **LLM-powered conversation interface** that translates natural language into structured commands.
- **Multi-party chat participation**, allowing the LLM to engage with multiple users while retrieving structured responses from agents.
- **State management for bot and conversations**, ensuring persistence and context awareness.
- **Modular design**, making it easy to add new agents and capabilities.

## **📌 LLM-Driven Conversational Flow**
The `/agent/action/parameters` syntax is precise but terse. The LLM acts as a **natural language interface** that understands user intent, generates valid agent requests, and reformats structured responses before sharing them with the group.

## **📖 Example Conversation**
### **🌍 Outer Dialog (Group Conversation with Humans)**
```
FROM: @Alice
TO: GROUP
MESSAGE: Hey, what's the status of our channels?
```

### **🤖 Inner Dialog (LLM Communicating with Agents)**
```
FROM: FRAN_LLM
TO: AGENTS
MESSAGE: /echo/list/
```

```
FROM: FRAN_AGENT
TO: AGENTS
MESSAGE: Active channels: #general, #bot
```

### **🌍 Outer Dialog (LLM Responds to the Group)**
```
FROM: FRAN_LLM
TO: GROUP
MESSAGE: We are currently active in #general and #bot
```
