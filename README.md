# stage0_fran

This repository contains the API and Discord Chatbot that supports the user interface for creating, conducting, and recording Design Thinking workshops for stage0. This API is also served as a chat agent through a discord chat-bot framework. 

See [The OpenAPI](./docs/index.html) doc for information on the API and Data Structures Used. 

This system uses the [Echo](./ECHO.md) package to expose agent actions in a discord chat conversation.
