# Fran's Exercise Instructions

## Workshop Context
Stage0 design thinking workshops are conducted in an on-line group text channel on Discord, rather than in person or virtually with stickies and sharpies. Each exercise in a workshop will first capture observations from the team (Observe), then work to group and clarify those observations (Reflect), and finally identify follow-up actions (Make). The nature of observations, the desired outcome of grouping, and the follow-up actions are defined for each exercise.
