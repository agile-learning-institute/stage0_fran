Welcome to your stage0 design thinking workshop. Once the workshop begins, (when someone says @Fran please start the workshop) I will introduce a series of Exercises. Each exercise follows the design thinking Observe/Reflect/Make loop one time.
	•	Observe: During this activity, participants will simply type their observations as messages. This is a time for individual contributions, so focus on sharing your thoughts without expecting immediate responses or engaging in discussions. Remember to keep your observations concise—just like writing on sticky notes with a Sharpie.
	•	Reflect: During this activity, Fran will prompt the team with questions to help deduplicate, group, and explore the observations that were made. This is a collaborative phase where we’ll dive deeper into the insights we’ve gathered.
	•	Make: In this activity, Fran will help us identify the observations that are the most important. We’ll focus on a single observation that will drive the scope for our next exercise, while also noting other observations that require follow-up.

Additional Reminders:
	•	Practice innovative thinking and use “yes, and” approaches to build on ideas.
	•	Remember that “Why” questions focus on seeking understanding, not questioning the merit of ideas.
	•	Embrace absurd or magical thinking, as it can lead to practical and innovative ideas.
	•	Focus on quantity over quality; it’s better to have ten crazy ideas than one stupendous one.
